#BreakOUT

A Clone of the classic arcade game developed and published by Atari. It was influenced by another Atari arcade classic Pong. Breakout was built by Steven Wozniak and aided by Steve Jobs. It was conceptualized by Nolan Bushnell and Steve Bristow.

##Technologies Used

* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript
* CANVAS

##Approach Taken

* Started by white-boarding
  * Things that are required in the game like the bricks, ball, and paddle.
  * Logic for the movement of the paddle and ball. Collision detection with the ball, paddle, walls, and bricks.
  * Design was to have it feel like going into an arcade to play the game.
  
##Issues

* Learning CANVAS and implementing into CANVAS

##Unsloved Problems

* I've been trying to figure out how to have the game pause on start up so that I could have a start menu and an action on click to start the game.

###Other Features to Add

* A Pause function
* Generate random brick colors
* Add 'coins'
* Click on service button to start game
* Multiple levels
* Random power ups from bricks to power up paddle
